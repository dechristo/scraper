# Scraper

# 1. Description
The application was developed with Angular 1.x for frontend and Karma-Jasmine for tests. The backend was implemented with Node.js using **Express** and **Cheerio**. The router was decoupled from the server script (app.js) so as the controller. The controller gatters all the data using **requests** and **cheerio** modules. For testing the modules used were: **mocha**, **chai** and **node_mocks_http**.

The application was developed and tested on a Linux Mint OS.
